## Summry
This repository is the demo repository for T-Mech submission, "Origami-inspired wearable robot for trunk support"

## Installnation

We have included pynamics as a submodule so there is no need to install pynamics seperately. Please use the pynamics module included in the submodule as further version of pynamics might not support these demos.

## Description

### Experiments simulation
Two code are used to repliacte the experiments:
  1. four_bar_2_exp.py is the code we used in Sec. III-D and Sec. IV-C
  2. triangle_exp.py is the code we used in Sec. III-D and Sec. IV-C
These two code were used to simulate the experiments only and not used towards the system calculation
### System calculation
Two slave code are used to calculate the system dimension
